### **1. Introduction**

We at Duc\'s App Lab, Ind. are committed to protecting your privacy and
securing your information when you use the CyberSafe app. This privacy
policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your
information.

### **2. Information Collection**

CyperSafe does not collect any personal information from you. All data,
including account information and TOTP codes, is created and managed by
you and stored locally on your device.

### **3. Encryption and Security**

We employ advanced security measures to safeguard your information:

- **AES Encryption:** All account information stored in the app is encrypted using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to ensure that only you can access your data.

- **No External Storage:** We do not store any data on external servers. All information is stored locally on your device, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Periodic Encryption Key Change:** To ensure the security of information through encryption, the application will have encryption keys for the information you enter. We will periodically change these encryption keys to ensure the safety of your information.


### **4. Lifetime Purchase Feature**

CyberSafe is a one-time purchase app, and you can use it for a lifetime
after purchase. There are no monthly or yearly fees. Simply make a
one-time purchase and use the app indefinitely.

### **5. Data Backup and Recovery**

CyberSafe supports data backup and recovery through AES-encrypted files.
This ensures that your backups are always secure and only accessible by
you.

 **Note:** _With the periodic encryption key change feature, because the backup files are also within the scope of our encryption, after updating to a new encryption key, all old backup files will no longer be usable to ensure security. However, after the update, we will require you to create a new backup, so you can be assured about your data. In case you delete the application for a long time and come back to use it, if the period overlaps with our encryption key update, you will also not be able to use the old backup files._

### **6. User Rights**

- **Access Rights:** You have full access to and control over your data.

- **Modification Rights:** You can edit account information at any time.

- **Deletion Rights:** You can delete any account information when no longer needed.
